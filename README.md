# WE WANT WASTE (Select Skip Page) Redesign - README

This repository outlines the major updates made in the redesign. Each change has been implemented to enhance user experience, improve accessibility, and ensure transparency. Below is a detailed explanation of the key modifications:

---

## 1. Lighter Theme for Improved Visibility

- **Overview:**  
  The entire page has been transitioned from a dark theme to a lighter color palette.
  
- **Reason:**  
  The previous dark theme often caused visual fatigue and made it difficult for users to quickly identify critical details, such as the size and price of items.

- **Benefit:**  
  With a lighter design, the page is easier on the eyes and allows important information to “pop,” making navigation more intuitive.

## 2. Modern & Simple User Interface

- **Overview:**  
  The UI has been overhauled to adopt a modern, minimalistic design approach.

- **Reason:**  
  The redesign was aimed at simplifying the user journey, reducing clutter, and focusing on the core action—selecting the item (waste skip).

- **Benefit:**  
  A straightforward and elegant interface ensures that users can effortlessly find and select the item, improving the overall experience.

## 3. Adoption of Roboto Flex Font

- **Overview:**  
  We have integrated the Roboto Flex font into our design.

- **Reason:**  
  This font was chosen for its readability and its ability to convey a calm, professional vibe, aligning with our design ethos.

- **Benefit:**  
  The typography not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also contributes to a relaxed user experience.

## 4. Diverse Item Images

- **Overview:**  
  Images associated with the items (waste skips) have been updated to showcase a diverse range of visuals.

- **Reason:**  
  The previous images were generic and did not adequately reflect the variety of items available. The new images (currently placeholders) are intended to better represent each unique listing.

- **Benefit:**  
  This update helps users quickly associate the visual context with the item details, leading to improved decision-making.

## 5. Optimized Positioning of Size Information

- **Overview:**  
  The position of the size information on each item listing has been adjusted.

- **Reason:**  
  By repositioning the size details, we emphasize the most important information for the user, ensuring it catches the eye immediately.

- **Benefit:**  
  This strategic placement supports quick comprehension of key details, enhancing the overall usability of the listing.

## 6. Transparent Pricing Breakdown with Tax Details

- **Overview:**  
  Pricing now includes the tax in the final amount. A tooltip helper has been added to break down the price into pre-VAT, VAT, and the total price.

- **Reason:**  
  Previously, users were left uncertain about the tax inclusion in the displayed price. This breakdown aims to demystify the pricing structure.

- **Benefit:**  
  Offering detailed price transparency builds trust with the user by clearly outlining how the final price is composed.

## 7. Enhanced Cart Drawer Functionality

- **Overview:**  
  When the "Select" button is clicked, the cart drawer automatically opens.

- **Reason:**  
  This improvement was made to streamline the transition from item selection to the next step, reducing any extra navigation steps.

- **Benefit:**  
  Users can immediately review their selected items and additional details, ensuring a smooth and efficient progression through the purchasing process.
